Boiler is a utility library that makes every day tasks in JavaScript easier by providing over 150 methods that play well
with other libraries. Boiler IS NOT a DOM manipulation library and doesn't require a browser to be useful. It's the
perfect solution for those requiring a slightly more robust Underscore.js-esque JavaScript utility library.
