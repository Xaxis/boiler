Boiler is a utility library that makes every day tasks in JavaScript easier by providing over 115 methods that work
on `arrays`, `collections`, `functions`, `numbers`, `objects`, and `strings`. It's the JavaScript equivalent of a
Swiss Army Knife.

[END NOTICE] I'm no longer able to maintain this library. Boiler.js was a great learning experience for me as a JavaScript developer. During its development I was able to push myself to the next level. That being said, I hope that the novel ideas boiler.js brought with it will help forkers and everyone else to make the JavaScript Utility Libraries of the future better and better.
